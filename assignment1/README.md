This is my project for Kannada Digits Recogniser
****
1. [init_imports.py]() is for all the packages utilized in my projects
2. [kannada_dennis.py]() is for self defined ResNet model, loss, accuracy function.
3. [kannada_res.ipynb]() is for using the resnet50 pretrained model but only change the conv1 and the fully-connected layer.
4. [kannada_fastres.ipynb]() is for a self-build ResNet model and using a easy training model for the fastapi

**I put all my time in kelp competition so only the first three files available now. I will finish all of that the later week, anyway 96.7% percent accuracy is rather good because it only runs 8 minutes on my local gpu**
